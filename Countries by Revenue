David formulated the below query to return the total number of customers and revenue by country. He then produced a visualization of the results in https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/datawarrior99/viz/RockbusterCustomersandRevenue/Dashboard1

SELECT country,
       COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count,
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON a.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY country
