David designed this query to return the top 5 customers in the top 5 cities by revenue (total amount paid). Again, he relied on the output of his previous query rather than constructing a subquery.

SELECT B. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, D. city, E. country, SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D. city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D. country_id=E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 'Kurashki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY B. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, D. city, E. country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) Desc
LIMIT 5
