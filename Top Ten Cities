David composed this query to find the top ten cities in the top ten countries by customer count. He capitalized on the results of the previous query rather than introducing a subquery.

SELECT C. city, D. country,
       COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
WHERE country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY city, country
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) Desc
LIMIT 10
