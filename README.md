# SQL
David completed a customer retention project for a fictional movie rental company's move to the streaming market.

Project Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

David was hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. His first task was to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, he used SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments had.

Finally, David compiled the results of his analysis into an easily digestible format, 
which was presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board asked a series of business questions and
expected data-driven answers that they could use for their 2020 company strategy. 

Here were the main questions:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

To answer the questions posed by the different departments, David queried the data using SQL. 

Data Set

David used a data set that containing information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. He firsd needed to load the data set into the PostgreSQL database. 

Project Deliverables

Final Analysis Criteria
David's final project was evaluated on his ability to:
● Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.
● Present SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling
a compelling story.
● Present SQL results to technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a
data dictionary.
● Create a professional project to add to a portfolio that could be shown to
employers.
