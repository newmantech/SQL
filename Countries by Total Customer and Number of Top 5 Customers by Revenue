David formulated a query to return a table showing countries by total customer count as well as the number of customers in each country who were in the top 5 by revenue. He then converted the query to a Common Table Expression (CTE) and compared the performance of the two queries. The CTE appeared to be more efficient.

Original:

SELECT D.country,
 COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT (top_five_table.country) AS 
top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
LEFT JOIN (SELECT B. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, D. city, E. country, SUM(amount) AS 
total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D. city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D. country_id=E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 'Kurashki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So 
Leopoldo')
GROUP BY B. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, D. city, E. country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) Desc
LIMIT 5
) AS top_five_table ON top_five_table.customer_id=A.customer_id
GROUP BY d.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC

CTE version:

WITH top_five_table_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS
 (SELECT B. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, D. city, E. country, SUM(amount) AS 
total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D. city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D. country_id=E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 'Kurashki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So 
Leopoldo')
GROUP BY B. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, D. city, E. country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) Desc
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country,
 COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT (top_five_table_cte.country) AS 
top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
LEFT JOIN top_five_table_cte ON top_five_table_cte.customer_id=A.customer_id
GROUP BY d.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
